# Object Detection for Candy Crush Game using OpenCV

## Project Description

This project uses OpenCV to detect and track objects based on color in the Candy Crush game. The goal is to identify specific colored candies on the game screen and perform image processing tasks to aid in automation or other game-related applications.

## Key Features

- **Color-Based Object Detection**: Detect objects based on specific colors (e.g., red, blue, yellow, orange, purple) in the game.
- **Object Highlighting**: Draw contours around detected objects and display their coordinates.
- **Image and Video Processing**: Supports processing both static images and videos from the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (install via `pip install opencv-python`)
- NumPy (install via `pip install numpy`)
